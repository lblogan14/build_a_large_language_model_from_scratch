# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer
This directory contains several implementations of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer algorithm. BPE is a popular subword tokenization technique used in natural language processing tasks, particularly in training language models.

- [`compare-bpe-tiktoken.ipynb`](compare-bpe-tiktoken.ipynb) benchmarks various byte pair encoding implementations.
- [`bpe_openai_gpt2.py`](bpe_openai_gpt2.py) is the original BPE code from OpenAI.

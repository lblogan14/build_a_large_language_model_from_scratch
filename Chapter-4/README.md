# Chapter 4: Implementing a GPT Model from Scratch to Generate Text

In this chapter, we will build a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch using PyTorch. We will implement the core components and assemble them into a complete model capable of generating text.

## 4.1 Coding an LLM Architecture

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to start coding the GPT model architecture step-by-step. The notebook will guide you through the implementation of the transformer blocks, attention mechanisms, and other essential components.

## 4.2 Normalizing Activations with Layer Normalization

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to learn about and implement layer normalization, a crucial technique for stabilizing and accelerating the training of deep neural networks, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs).

## 4.3 Implementing a Feed-Forward Network with GELU Activations

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to implement a feed-forward neural network (FFN) with Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activations, which are commonly used in transformer architectures for their smooth and non-linear properties.

## 4.4 Adding Shortcut Connections

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to implement shortcut connections (also known as residual connections) in the transformer architecture, which help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and improve training efficiency.

## 4.5 Connecting Attention and Linear Layers in a Transformer Block

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to connect the attention mechanisms and linear layers within a transformer block, completing the core structure of the GPT model.

## 4.6 Coding the GPT Model

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to assemble all the components into a complete GPT model, ready for training and text generation tasks.

## 4.7 Generating Text

Switch to [`main.ipynb`](./main/main.ipynb) to implement text generation capabilities using the GPT model, allowing it to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.
